  abstract   = {In statistics, kernel density estimation (KDE) is the application of kernel smoothing for probability density estimation, i.e., a non-parametric method to estimate the probability density function of a random variable based on kernels as weights. KDE answers a fundamental data smoothing problem where inferences about the population are made, based on a finite data sample. In some fields such as signal processing and econometrics it is also termed the Parzen\textendash Rosenblatt window method,  after Emanuel Parzen and Murray Rosenblatt, who are usually credited with independently creating it in its current form. One of the famous applications of kernel density estimation is in estimating the class-conditional marginal densities of data when using a naive Bayes classifier, which can improve its prediction accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Kernel density estimation is nowadays very popular tool for nonparametric probabilistic density estimation. One of its most important disadvantages is computational complexity of computations needed, especially for large data sets. One way for accelerating these computations is to use the parallel computing with multi-core platforms. In this paper we parallelize two kernel estimation methods such as the univariate and multivariate kernel estimation from the field of the computational econometrics on multi-core platform using different programming frameworks such as Pthreads, OpenMP, Intel Cilk++, Intel TBB, SWARM and FastFlow. The purpose of this paper is to present an extensive quantitative (i.e., performance) and qualitative (i.e., the ease of programming effort) study of the multi-core programming frameworks for these two kernel estimation methods.},
